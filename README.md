In the kingdom of cyber security, maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information while evading detection by adversaries is of paramount importance. This abstract presents a novel approach to conceal confidential files through the application of advanced cryptography techniques, specifically focusing on the transformation of any type of files into MP4 format.The fusion of advanced cryptography with multimedia formats introduces intriguing possibilities and challenges. This project endeavors to explore the integration of sophisticated cryptographic techniques within MP4 (MPEG-4) video files, leveraging the capabilities of Kali Linux. Through experimental validation and analysis, this abstract elucidates the efficacy and feasibility of employing MP4-based cryptography as a clandestine means of safeguarding sensitive data. By concealing confidential files within innocuous multimedia containers, organizations and individuals can mitigate the risk of data breaches and espionage while maintaining a low profile in adversarial environments. This innovative approach represents a significant advancement in the field of cyber security, offering a potent defense against sophisticated adversaries seeking to compromise sensitive information.
